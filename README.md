## Introduction

NoBis is as a totally anonymous service that permits to measure, in real-time, how crowded the public environments are. The objective is to make it possible for city residents, visitors, workers, travelers, and the whole community to identify in advance the most crowded areas and adapt their mobility decisions accordingly. NoBis is implemented based on the QR technology, a matrix-type barcode that, when scanned, triggers check-in/check-out operations to/from the public spaces that are being monitored. NoBis imposes as an anonymous, privacy-compliant, easy-to-use, ready-to- deploy, and totally free service, and represents a promising tool in the fight against the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this document we provide details about NoBisâ€™ development status and implementation, and present the results of a preliminary on-the-field testing phase demonstrating the smooth and proper functioning of NoBis as well as its potential social impact on humanity and community.
